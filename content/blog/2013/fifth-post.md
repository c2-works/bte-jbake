MECHANICAL CREEP BEHAVIOUR TESTING EQUIPMENT
Mechanical creep behaviour testing equipment for leather samples

consisting of:
Framework rack for the admission of 5 tensioning
Load applying over weights
Working strength ever 50 to 200 N at each tensioning
Device accuracy of the working strength +/- 1 % of the final strength from 50 to 200 N
The individual tensioning devices are mechanically decoupled, in order to avoid oscillations with the sample breakage
5 specimen mounting plates

Test task:
Determination of the length variation of creep samples during a long-term stress test

Equipment:
Load test stand with 5 load stations, respective maximum permissible load 200N by applying of maximally 4 50N-plates, enterprise by pneumatic circuit.

Accessories:
on request

Characteristic:
Percussion protection for the impact absorption of the metal parts

Software on request!
