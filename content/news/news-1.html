<p>In March, BTE & Hegewald & Peschke MPT GmbH delivered a double alternating bending test rig and a tilting test rig equipped with the new programmable logic control to the Norwegian company Scandinavian Business Seating AS. In the production plant in Røros, these rigs are used to test office seating furniture. Likewise, TÜV SÜD in Hamburg commissioned an seat/backrest alternating bending test rig and a test rig for arm rest testing equipped with the new Calmar I technology. By means of these test rigs, seat, backrest, arm rest tests and side-to-side tests are carried out in accordance with the standards EN 1335 and BS 5459.</p>
