<p>The 1720 ProfessionalLine model is the most innovative development in state-of-the-art internal pressure creep testers. 
Its compact design, flexibility and precision remain unparalleled.</p>
<p>Keeping a finger on the pulse: The maxim for the new development was to attain maximum accuracy, 
a long service life and a user- and service-friendly system, combined with flexibility and the precondition to be able to expand the system with additional modules.</p>
<p>High-precision pressure regulation. Selectively regulated input pressure in each individual module ensures reduced wear to the solenoid valves.</p>
<p>Optimised material selection. All metal components that come in contact with the medium can optionally be manufactured out of high quality stainless steel, 
entirely free of copper ions. In addition to preventing corrosion, the materials also ensure that the test results will be reliable. Standard units are supplied in brass.</p>
<p>Quick system calibration: The  integrated  needle  valves enable a direct link to be established to the optional master gauge even while testing is underway.</p>
<p>Room to grow: The modular structure and the technical requirement for test pressures, optionally up to maximum 600 bar leave room for further expansion.</p>

<p>According to following standards:</p>
<ul class="style2">
	<li>ISO 1167</li>
	<li>ASTM D 1598</li>
	<li>ASTM D 1599</li>
