<p id="news-4">BTE and Hegewald & Peschke Mess- und Pr√ºftechnik GmbH have installed a double test bench for side-to-side and armrest tests as well as a double-flexure test bench for seat-backrest and side-to-side or armrest testing to RICE Technical Research Institute of Sweden.</p>

<p>While seat bench-backrest and armrest testing as a dual-flex change-over tester is primarily cost-effective and cost-effective for the customer and both tests can operate independently, such as stand-alone test stands, the double test bench has been designed for armrest or side-to-side testing. that also sofas and other upholstered furniture can be tested. For this purpose, the center column was shortened and the width increased, so that the two outer cylinders can be used for the armrests. In addition, here too two conventional chairs can be tested simultaneously and independently of each other.</p>

<p>The change between armrest testing and side-to-side testing is extremely simple: the thrust pieces are replaced with the tried-and-tested terminal connection, the cylinders are adjusted to the required position and limited in their mobility or completely locked and the appropriate test templates are set - afterwards the test can start. <br />
The test bench for the seat backrest test allows testing according to BIFMA X5.1 and the usual German standards - in particular according to EN 1335. Furthermore, it can be tested to BS 5459.</p>
